Subsonic-Enhancement-Kit is a bunch of user scripts that aim to improve the subsonic experience.

- better-with-thumbnail:    Displays directories in artist view as albums.

- fat-art:                  Removes the 300x300 restriction when downloading last.fm album artworks.
- lyrics:                   Makes the lyrics button fetch lyrics from lyrics.wikia.com
- randombar:                Adds a quick access random button to generate playlists from home page.
- [overdated] short-bio:    Shortens the artist bios (since last.fm recent modifications the full bios are displayed).
- sm-rating-extractor:      Displays ratings from Sputnikmusic over subsonic album thumbnails.
