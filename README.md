# Subsonic-Enhancement-Kit

Subsonic-Enhancement-Kit is a bunch of user scripts that aim to improve the subsonic experience.

- better-with-thumbnail:    Displays directories in artist view as albums.
- cosmetic:                 Tweaks the CSS in order to have 8x5 album grid on a 1080p resolution with Firefox and remove update warnings above the "now playing" area.
- lyrics:                   Makes the lyrics button fetch lyrics from lyrics.wikia.com
- randombar:                Adds a quick access random button to generate playlists from home page.
- sm-rating-extractor:      Displays ratings from Sputnikmusic over subsonic album thumbnails.
- index-search:             Makes links of the artist names in the left index so they become hitable with "Enter".
