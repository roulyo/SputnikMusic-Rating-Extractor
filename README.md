# Subsonic-Enhancement-Kit

Subsonic-Enhancement-Kit is a bunch of Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey scripts that aim to improve the subsonic experience.

- sm-rating-extractor.js displays ratings from Sputnikmusic over subsonic album thumbnails.
- short-bio.js shortens the artist bios (since last.fm recent modifications the full bios are displayed).
